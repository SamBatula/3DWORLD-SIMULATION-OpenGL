# 3DWORLD-SIMULATION-OpenGL

# Description

3D World Simulator is a simulator where you are able to interact with various things inside the world. 
Tasks such as:
Walking around the 3D world
Opening the door to enter the house
Opening the blinds on the window in house
Turning on and off a light via lightswitch

Lights, animation, materials, collision detection and more were used to create this Simulation. 

*NOTE* The code above, collision detection is not enabled. 
I will be updating this project periodically within the next few months.

The game is made with OpenGL engine. OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit, to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

Using OpenGl, a 3d model of the Rubiks cube was created. You are able to rotate the world to view each face of the cube. Upon solving the cube, fireworks will automatically display once the last face match.
